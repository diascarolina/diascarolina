I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡ ([UFC](http://www.ufc.br/)), Brazil.

I am interested in Data Science and its applications, as well as all things involving Machine Learning and AI. For three years, I worked in undergraduate research at the ParGo Research Group (Parallel Computing, Graph Theory and Optimization) in the area of Graph Theory, focusing on graph convexity and algorithmic complexity.

Currently I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Creditas.

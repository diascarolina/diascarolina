### A little bit about myself...

- 💡 **Machine Learning Engineer** at [Creditas](https://boards.greenhouse.io/creditas/).
- 👩‍💻 Master's student in **Computer Science** at State University of Ceará ([UECE](http://www.uece.br/)), with a focus on Machine Learning and Graph Theory.
- ♾ B.Sc. in **Mathematics** from Universidade Federal do Ceará ([UFC](http://www.ufc.br/)).

I am interested in Data Science and its applications, as well as all things involving Machine Learning and AI. For three years, I worked in undergraduate research at the ParGo Research Group (Parallel Computing, Graph Theory and Optimization) in the area of Graph Theory, focusing on graph convexity and algorithmic complexity. And now I'm always learning something new.

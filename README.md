I'm about to graduate in Mathematics from Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡ ([UFC](http://www.ufc.br/)), Brazil. I am interested in Data Science and its applications, as well as all things involving Machine Learning. For three years, I worked in undergraduate research at the ParGo Research Group (Parallel Computing, Graph Theory and Optimization) in the area of Graph Theory, focusing on graph convexity and algorithmic complexity.


Currently, I'm specializing my studies in:
- <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/17/000000/python.png"/> Python
  - Pandas / Numpy / Matplotlib / Seaborn / Scikit-Learn
- <img src="https://img.icons8.com/doodle/17/000000/learning.png"/> Machine Learning and its algorithms
- <img src="https://img.icons8.com/dusk/17/000000/area-chart.png"/> Data Storytelling
- <img src="https://img.icons8.com/officexs/17/000000/database.png"/> SQL

And many others, when I have the time.
